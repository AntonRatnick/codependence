# Codependence

**Codependence, for code dependency. Because when it is needed, IT IS NEEDED!**

Codependence is a JavaScript utility tool for checking dependencies in a project to ensure they're up-to-date or match specified version(s).

## Synopsis

Codependence is JavaScript utility that checks a `codependencies` array against `package.json` files to ensure `codependencies` are up-to-date.
Optionally, `codependencies` items can be set to an object with a set version and Codependence will ensure the `package.json`'s dependencies match the codependencies.

This utility can be useful for ensuring very dependent dependencies are always up-to-dateâ€”or, at least, installed at a specified version.
